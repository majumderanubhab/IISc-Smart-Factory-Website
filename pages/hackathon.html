            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is the overall format of the hackathon?</strong><br>
                    The hackathon runs for 2–3 days, featuring approximately 50 curated problem statements across
                    domains such
                    as IoT, AI, Cybersecurity, and Manufacturing. It consists of three rounds: Idea Pitch, Prototype/PoC
                    development, and Final Pitch presenting the solution and business impact.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Who is eligible to participate?</strong><br>
                    Open to students, professionals, researchers, and startups. All team members must be 18 years or
                    older at
                    registration.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How do participants register and form teams?</strong><br>
                    Registration is via the official website and accepts individuals or teams of 2–5 members. Teams
                    choose one
                    problem statement from the published list; organizers may adjust allocations to balance team
                    distributions.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What if team sizes vary significantly?</strong><br>
                    Ideal team sizes are 2–5 or 4–7 members. Larger teams may limit active contributors per task;
                    smaller or
                    solo participants may merge into larger teams or receive extra support.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What are the technical eligibility requirements?</strong><br>
                    Participants must have skills relevant to their chosen problem statement. Skillsets and interests
                    are
                    collected during registration, and organizers may guide or flag teams with insufficient expertise.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What support is provided before and during the event?</strong><br>
                    Pre-hackathon webinars and Q&amp;A sessions explain problem statements, judging criteria, incubation
                    pathways, and mentor guidelines. Assigned mentors provide ongoing domain guidance without coding.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are mentors allocated and managed?</strong><br>
                    One mentor is assigned per problem or cluster of related problems, providing rotational and virtual
                    guidance
                    to cover all teams effectively.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What deliverables are expected from each team?</strong><br>
                    Teams must submit:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Round 1: Idea Pitch Deck (problem statement, solution approach, feasibility)</li>
                        <li>Round 2: Working Prototype/MVP demo</li>
                        <li>Round 3: Final Presentation including prototype demo, business model, scalability plan</li>
                        <li>Source Code and documentation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>What are the judging criteria?</strong><br>
                    Judging is based on five equally weighted categories: Innovation &amp; Creativity, Technical
                    Feasibility,
                    Business Viability, Scalability &amp; Sustainability, and Presentation &amp; Teamwork, each
                    contributing
                    20%.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What happens if a team cannot complete a prototype?</strong><br>
                    Teams may submit detailed designs, simulations, or proof of concept documents. Judges consider
                    technical
                    feasibility and team effort as part of evaluation.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Are there rules regarding the use of software, code, and resources?</strong><br>
                    Open-source libraries, publicly available APIs, and provided datasets may be used respecting
                    licensing.
                    Proprietary or pre-built projects require explicit approval. Majority of development must happen
                    during
                    hackathon timeframe.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can teams consult outside mentors or experts?</strong><br>
                    Only assigned mentors may provide guidance. External consultation is disallowed unless approved by
                    organizers.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How is intellectual property (IP) handled?</strong><br>
                    Teams retain IP rights over their creations. IP terms for incubation are governed by separate
                    agreements.
                    Organizers can use names, photos, and demo content for promotion with team consent.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What if external services fail during the event?</strong><br>
                    Organizers are not responsible for failures of internet, electricity, or other external services but
                    will
                    try to assist where possible.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are disputes or misconduct handled?</strong><br>
                    A strict code of conduct applies. Violations (harassment, discrimination, unprofessional behavior)
                    may lead
                    to disqualification. Organizers mediate disputes; decisions are final.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How is confidentiality maintained?</strong><br>
                    Teams must use datasets only for hackathon purposes and keep organizer or partner data confidential.

                <li><strong>What does post-hackathon incubation involve?</strong><br>
                    Promising teams receive mentorship and provide support for seed funding, support in industry
                    connections and
                    pilot runs, and 3–6 months of monitoring from the start of the program.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How is management of ~50 problem statements handled?</strong><br>
                    Organizers balance team distribution across problem statements, merging or reallocating teams to
                    lesser-chosen problems to ensure competition.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What if some problems have very few participants?</strong><br>
                    Problem statements may be combined or teams encouraged to change their selection early in
                    registration to
                    maintain problem engagement.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are incomplete teams or dropouts mitigated?</strong><br>
                    Pre-event orientation stresses commitment. Standby participants and team merges help address
                    dropouts.
                    Mentors conduct checkpoints to identify issues early.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can teams change members or problem statements mid-event?</strong><br>
                    Team compositions are frozen after confirmation; changes require PIO/organizer approval and are
                    discouraged.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What if a team member leaves during the event?</strong><br>
                    Replacement is possible with organizer consent.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Are presentations public?</strong><br>
                    Final presentations are delivered before a jury panel and may be open to mentors and other
                    participants.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Is networking facilitated?</strong><br>
                    Multiple sessions for informal networking with mentors, organizers, industry guests, and incubators
                    are
                    planned.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Are there participation fees?</strong><br>
                    TBD
                </li>

                <li><strong>How is mentor availability handled when many teams participate?</strong><br>
                    One mentor per problem or related problem cluster provides rotational support to manage mentoring
                    workload
                    effectively.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What fallback resources exist if hardware or APIs fail?</strong><br>
                    Cloud tools, open-source alternatives, and simulations are recommended fallback options.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can teams submit alternative approaches if prototyping fully isn't feasible?</strong><br>
                    Yes, simulations, conceptual designs, and documentation are acceptable alternatives.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are remote participation and time zones managed for hackathon?</strong><br>
                    Remote participation is not encouraged.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What coding and presentation languages are allowed?</strong><br>
                    Any coding language is allowed; presentations and documentation must be in English.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are IP disputes among team members resolved?</strong><br>
                    Teams should agree on IP ownership beforehand; organizers provide guidance but do not mediate legal
                    disputes.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can teams submit fixes after the deadline?</strong><br>
                    No late submissions are allowed; incubation phase may allow post-event improvements.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Is participant feedback provided after the event?</strong><br>
                    Feedback sessions or reports from judges and mentors are offered post-event.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What ensures judging fairness and transparency?</strong><br>
                    Final decision will be by Jury at IISc, according to the established, balanced criteria
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are technical submission issues handled?</strong><br>
                    Teams must ensure proper formatting and functionality pre-deadline; support is offered before but
                    not after
                    the deadline.
