                            Judges will assess each criterion based on both qualitative and quantitative aspects, ensuring a balanced evaluation of creativity, technical feasibility, business potential, scalability, and teamwork. Evaluation will be conducted in three stages, aligned with the hackathon rounds: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Idea Pitch: Judges review clarity of problem understanding, originality of the solution, and potential business impact.</li>
                                <li>Prototype / PoC Development: Judges assess the working prototype for functionality, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies, feasibility, and demonstration of real-world applicability.</li>
                                <li>Final Pitch: Judges evaluate the complete solution, including technical performance, industrial scalability, sustainability, business model, novelty of the solution, and team presentation.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Judges’ decisions are final and binding. No appeals will be entertained. Tiebreakers may be decided by an additional Q&amp;A round with shortlisted teams.

                                <li>Failure to execute work as planned in the project, show progress, or deliver as planned may lead to withdrawal of support, forfeiture of benefits, and recovery of funds or resources as per the MoU. Periodic performance reviews will determine continuation; non-compliance or breach will result in termination of incubation, and IISc’s decision under the MoU will be final and enforceable.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Intellectual Property (IP) created during the hackathon will remain with the team. If selected for incubation, IP terms (ownership, licensing, or revenue-sharing, if any) will be defined through a separate legal agreement with the incubator. By participating, teams grant organizers the right to use names, photos, solution descriptions, and demo videos for promotional purposes.

    <!-- <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="welcome-body">

            <ul>
                <li><strong>I am a student. Am I eligible to participate?</strong><br>
                    If you are selected for incubation, you will need to drop out of your current education program so that you fully commit your time and effort to the startup. Register only if you agree to this condition.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can I select my team member/s before the hackathon?</strong><br>
                    Yes, as long as they agree to teaming up with you and register for the same hackathon as individuals.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can I change teams mid-way during the hackathon?</strong><br>
                    We discourage changing teams. You may change teams until the evening of day-1 by mutual agreement with your previous and new team members, and approval of organisers.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What if I am unable to join or form a team?</strong><br>
                    Team formation is the participant's responsibility. We are not bound to enforce team formation.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What are the technical eligibility requirements?</strong><br>
                    Participants must have skills relevant to their chosen problem statement. Skillsets and interests are collected during registration, and organizers may guide or flag teams with insufficient expertise.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What support is provided before and during the event?</strong><br>
                    Pre-hackathon webinars and Q&amp;A sessions explain problem statements, judging criteria, incubation pathways, and mentor guidelines. Assigned mentors provide ongoing domain guidance without coding.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are mentors allocated and managed?</strong><br>
                    One mentor is assigned per problem or cluster of related problems, providing rotational and virtual guidance to cover all teams effectively.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What deliverables are expected from each team?</strong><br>
                    Teams must submit:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Round 1: Idea Pitch Deck (problem statement, solution approach, feasibility)</li>
                        <li>Round 2: Working Prototype/MVP demo</li>
                        <li>Round 3: Final Presentation including prototype demo, business model, scalability plan</li>
                        <li>Source Code and documentation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>What are the judging criteria?</strong><br>
                    Judging is based on five equally weighted categories: Innovation &amp; Creativity, Technical Feasibility, Business Viability, Scalability &amp; Sustainability, and Presentation &amp; Teamwork, each contributing 20%.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What happens if a team cannot complete a prototype?</strong><br>
                    Teams may submit detailed designs, simulations, or proof of concept documents. Judges consider technical feasibility and team effort as part of evaluation.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Are there rules regarding the use of software, code, and resources?</strong><br>
                    Open-source libraries, publicly available APIs, and provided datasets may be used respecting
                    licensing.
                    Proprietary or pre-built projects require explicit approval. Majority of development must happen
                    during hackathon timeframe.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can teams consult outside mentors or experts?</strong><br>
                    Only assigned mentors may provide guidance. External consultation is disallowed unless approved by
                    organizers.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How is intellectual property (IP) handled?</strong><br>
                    Teams retain IP rights over their creations. IP terms for incubation are governed by separate
                    agreements.
                    Organizers can use names, photos, and demo content for promotion with team consent.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What if external services fail during the event?</strong><br>
                    Organizers are not responsible for failures of internet, electricity, or other external services but
                    will try to assist where possible.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are disputes or misconduct handled?</strong><br>
                    A strict code of conduct applies. Violations (harassment, discrimination, unprofessional behavior)
                    may lead to disqualification. Organizers mediate disputes; decisions are final.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How is confidentiality maintained?</strong><br>
                    Teams must use datasets only for hackathon purposes and keep organizer or partner data confidential.
                    Legal actions apply on violations.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are winners selected and recognized?</strong><br>
                    No winners are officially declared. Teams selected should be ready for incubation and are expected to fully commit to further developing their solutions, with guidance from mentors and access to incubation resources.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What does post-hackathon incubation involve?</strong><br>
                    Promising teams receive mentorship and provide support for seed funding, support in industry
                    connections and pilot runs, and 3–6 months of monitoring from the start of the program.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How is management of ~50 problem statements handled?</strong><br>
                    Organizers balance team distribution across problem statements, merging or reallocating teams to
                    lesser-chosen problems to ensure competition.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What if some problems have very few participants?</strong><br>
                    Problem statements may be combined or teams encouraged to change their selection early in
                    registration to maintain problem engagement.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are incomplete teams or dropouts mitigated?</strong><br>
                    Pre-event orientation stresses commitment. Standby participants and team merges help address
                    dropouts.
                    Mentors conduct checkpoints to identify issues early.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can teams change members or problem statements mid-event?</strong><br>
                    Team compositions are frozen after confirmation; changes require PIO/organizer approval and are
                    discouraged.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What if a team member leaves during the event?</strong><br>
                    Replacement is possible with organizer consent.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Are presentations public?</strong><br>
                    Final presentations are delivered before a jury panel and may be open to mentors and other
                    participants.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Is networking facilitated?</strong><br>
                    Multiple sessions for informal networking with mentors, organizers, industry guests, and incubators
                    are planned.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Are there participation fees?</strong><br>
                    The fees are ₹ 530 / head per hackathon.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How is mentor availability handled when many teams participate?</strong><br>
                    One mentor per problem or related problem cluster provides rotational support to manage mentoring workload effectively.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What fallback resources exist if hardware or APIs fail?</strong><br>
                    Cloud tools, open-source alternatives, and simulations are recommended fallback options.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can teams submit alternative approaches if prototyping fully isn't feasible?</strong><br>
                    Yes, simulations, conceptual designs, and documentation are acceptable alternatives.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are remote participation and time zones managed for hackathon?</strong><br>
                    Remote participation is not encouraged.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What coding and presentation languages are allowed?</strong><br>
                    Any coding language is allowed; presentations and documentation must be in English.
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are IP disputes among team members resolved?</strong><br>
                    Teams should agree on IP ownership beforehand; organizers provide guidance but do not mediate legal disputes.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Can teams submit fixes after the deadline?</strong><br>
                    No late submissions are allowed; incubation phase may allow post-event improvements.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Is participant feedback provided after the event?</strong><br>
                    Feedback sessions or reports from judges and mentors are offered post-event.
                </li>

                <li><strong>What ensures judging fairness and transparency?</strong><br>
                    Final decision will be by Jury at IISc, according to the established, balanced criteria
                </li>

                <li><strong>How are technical submission issues handled?</strong><br>
                    Teams must ensure proper formatting and functionality pre-deadline; support is offered before but not after the deadline.
