        <h3>Building the Future of Smart Manufacturing & Industry 4.0</h3>
        <p>
            This initiative by the CEFC of Smart Factory at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is focused on
            mentoring and supporting startups
            driving the next wave of innovation in Smart Manufacturing and Industrial Automation.
        </p>

        <p>Over a span of three years, the project will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct 3 National Hackathons — one each year — to identify 30 high-potential startup teams.</li>
            <li>Support 30 Startups (10 per year) with end-to-end mentoring, technical guidance, and business
                development in Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0.</li>
            <li>Provide Targeted Training & Upskilling for incubates, helping them transition critical technologies to
                the MSME sector.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why This Program?</h3>
        <p>
            India's startup ecosystem holds immense potential — yet over 90% of startups fail within the first five
            years, often due to a lack of mentoring
            and innovation support. This program bridges that gap by providing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strategic Mentorship from academia, industry, and investors.</li>
            <li>Training Facilities and Expert Resources to help startups build market-ready solutions.</li>
            <li>Access to Ecosystem Partners, enabling collaboration, fundraising, and faster go-to-market strategies.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Backed by Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Led by Prof. Amaresh Chakrabarti, Senior Professor and Chair at the Department of Design and
                Manufacturing, IISc.</li>
            <li>Built on the strong foundation of the completed Phase-I CEFC project, with over 8,100 professionals
                trained in Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing, PLM, and Machining.</li>
            <li>Supported by MHI and Tata Steel, with a total project cost of INR 15.3 Cr.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Up to 30 Startups Supported</li>
            <li>70% Success Rate Expected, based on IISc’s proven incubation model</li>
            <li>315+ New Jobs Created</li>
            <li>INR 210 Cr+ Market Value Generated</li>
            <li>1050 MSMEs Benefited in the first 5 years post-launch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Long-Term Sustainability</h3>
        <p>
            Post the initial 3-year support phase, the startups are expected to raise their own funding and continue
            generating impact.
            The Training & Business Incubation (TBI) facility at IISc will continue supporting them in raising up to INR
            50L per startup annually.
        </p>
