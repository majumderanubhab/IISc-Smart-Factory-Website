        <h3>Building the Future of Smart Manufacturing & Industry 4.0</h3>
        <p>
            This initiative by the CEFC of Smart Factory at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is focused on
            mentoring and supporting startups
            driving the next wave of innovation in Smart Manufacturing and Industrial Automation.
        </p>

        <p>Over a span of three years, the project will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct 3 National Hackathons — one each year — to identify 30 high-potential startup teams.</li>
            <li>Support 30 Startups (10 per year) with end-to-end mentoring, technical guidance, and business
                development in Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0.</li>
            <li>Provide Targeted Training & Upskilling for incubates, helping them transition critical technologies to
                the MSME sector.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why This Program?</h3>
        <p>
            India's startup ecosystem holds immense potential — yet over 90% of startups fail within the first five
            years, often due to a lack of mentoring
            and innovation support. This program bridges that gap by providing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strategic Mentorship from academia, industry, and investors.</li>
            <li>Training Facilities and Expert Resources to help startups build market-ready solutions.</li>
            <li>Access to Ecosystem Partners, enabling collaboration, fundraising, and faster go-to-market strategies.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Backed by Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Led by Prof. Amaresh Chakrabarti, Senior Professor and Chair at the Department of Design and
                Manufacturing, IISc.</li>
            <li>Built on the strong foundation of the completed Phase-I CEFC project, with over 8,100 professionals
                trained in Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing, PLM, and Machining.</li>
            <li>Supported by MHI and Tata Steel, with a total project cost of INR 15.3 Cr.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Up to 30 Startups Supported</li>
            <li>70% Success Rate Expected, based on IISc’s proven incubation model</li>
            <li>315+ New Jobs Created</li>
            <li>INR 210 Cr+ Market Value Generated</li>
            <li>1050 MSMEs Benefited in the first 5 years post-launch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Long-Term Sustainability</h3>
        <p>
            Post the initial 3-year support phase, the startups are expected to raise their own funding and continue
            generating impact.
            The Training & Business Incubation (TBI) facility at IISc will continue supporting them in raising up to INR
            50L per startup annually.
        </p>

        <h3>Join the Mission</h3>
        <p>
            If you're a startup or aspiring entrepreneur in the Smart Manufacturing or Industry 4.0 space, this is your
            opportunity to be mentored,
            supported, and launched into success.

        <h3>Smart Fastener Development</h3>
        <div class="welcome-body">
            <p><i class="fas fa-align-left"></i> The project involves the development of smart fasteners at three
                distinct ranges to cater to various critical applications across segments. These smart fasteners will
                feature a reliable measuring technique, quantitative output, digital connectivity, instant monitoring
                with a device, part-level traceability, and customizable options to suit different segments. Engineered
                fastening is a $100 billion industry serving a wide range of sectors from automotive to infrastructure.
                A major challenge in this industry has been accurately measuring, predicting, or estimating the clamp
                loads applied to joints, which is essential for evaluating fastening reliability. With recent
                advancements and the miniaturization of sensor technology, there is renewed interest in developing smart
                fasteners. In critical heavy engineering applications, such smart fasteners could help predict
                maintenance schedules and provide greater assurance.</p>

        <h3>Machine for Friction & Linear Friction Welding of Long Pipes, rods and structural components</h3>
        <div class="welcome-body">
            <p><i class="fas fa-align-left"></i> This project aims to enhance solid-state welding techniques such as
                friction stir welding and linear friction welding to enable the joining of longer components like pipes,
                rods, and parts of various shapes. These welding methods, which rely on friction-generated heat and
                pressure rather than melting, are known for producing high-quality, efficient welds, especially in
                materials like aluminium. However, current limitations in equipment design restrict the size of parts
                that can be effectively welded. The project addresses this challenge by developing a solution that
                allows for the welding of longer and more complex aluminium structures. This advancement will enable the
                fabrication of lightweight, all-aluminium assemblies suitable for automotive and other structural
                applications. It also opens the possibility of welding aluminium alloys that are typically difficult or
                impossible to join using conventional fusion welding methods, thereby improving manufacturing
                flexibility and overall weld integrity.</p>

        <h3>Material design and process for additive manufacturing of "cement-free" hollow-core members containing
            earth-based materials and recycled fines from construction and demolition waste</h3>
        <div class="welcome-body">
            <p><i class="fas fa-align-left"></i> The project aims to establish a state-of-the-art advanced 3D printing
                and characterization facility focused on low-carbon manufacturing and research for prefabricated and

                print-head/nozzle designs and process parameters for printing hollow-core components using
                alkali-activated materials and construction and demolition (C&D) waste fines. A major focus is the
                creation of 3D printable earth-based alkali-activated materials by partially replacing fine M-sand
                (30-60%) with recycled fines and soil. The project will investigate the impact of these sustainable
                materials on the microstructure, mechanical performance, and durability of 3D printed structures.
                Further, it involves prototyping and on-site monitoring of printed hollow-core panels and wall
                components to demonstrate real-world applicability. This initiative aims to instil confidence among
                construction stakeholders and promote technology adoption, while enabling knowledge transfer and
                commercialization opportunities for Indian MSMEs in the sustainable construction sector.</p>
