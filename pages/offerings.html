    <h2>M.Tech. in SMART MANUFACTURING</h2>
    <div class="welcome-body">
        <p>
            We currently have 26 M.Tech. candidates with us, of which twenty were recruited this year. The
            remaining six students have completed one year of training, were recruited last year and have
            undergone 12 courses during this training.</p>
        <p><br>
            Started in 2019, the Master of Technology (MTech) programme is a two-year full-time graduate
            programme that aims to impart education in smart manufacturing and development of new
            manufacturing systems that are innovative and competitive. The programme aims at developing skills,
            knowledge and aptitude among students so that they can have a 360 degree view of manufacturing
            as "physical production at the centre of a wider manufacturing value chain" where "highly agile,
            networked enterprises use information and analytics as skillfully as they employ talent and machinery
            to deliver products and services to diverse global markets". The course is intended to create future
            leaders in manufacturing who not only master the state of the art in current design, manufacturing,
            technology, management and business aspects in the area of smart manufacturing, but also can usher
            in manufacturing innovation in these through creative problem solving and integration of deep
            technology from diverse, multiple disciplines.</p>
        <p><br>
            The MTech programme at CPDM is offered in partnership with faculty members from over twelve
            departments of IISc, and is spread over four semesters and two summer terms. It contains a
            challenging mix of courses and projects in materials, processes, digital manufacturing, design
            methodology, CAD, PLM, sensors, mechatronics, AI, analytics, machine learning, operations
            management, etc. to train students in the technology behind advanced manufacturing at various
            scales of systems (process, machines, factories, enterprises) and production, as well as in innovating
            new manufacturing processes and systems that blend the soft and the hard skills to solve problems
            related to manufacturing industry.</p>
        <p><br>
            Candidates with a bachelor's degree in Engineering or equivalent and with a valid GATE score are
            eligible to apply. Selection is based on GATE score and performance in an interview conducted at the
            centre. The interview tests engineering knowledge, abstract and analytical thinking ability,
            communication ability, and overall aptitude for smart manufacturing.
            The Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing offers industry opportunity for internships during
            summer (two months during May-July each year) and for recruiting students graduating from the
            Master of Technology (M.Tech) course specializing in Smart Manufacturing.

    <h2>RESEARCH PROGRAMME in ADVANCED MANUFACTURING</h2>
    <div class="welcome-body">
        <p>
            We currently have 13 PhD candidates with us, of which seven were recruited this year. The remaining
            six students have completed one year of training, were recruited last year and have undergone 4
            courses during this training.</p><br>
        <p>
            The research programme at CPDM (MTech by Research and PhD) in Advanced Manufacturing is
            carried out in a variety of areas, materials and processes, digital manufacturing, manufacturing supply
            chains, sustainable manufacturing, Industry 4.0, controls/autonomous systems and robotics, and
            policy and entrepreneurship in manufacturing. CPDM pioneered research in the area of smart
            manufacturing in India with the initiation of India's first indigenous Smart Factory research platform
            in 2015 in collaboration with The Boeing Company, USA; Boeing is a strategic partner of IISc, similar
            to University Cambridge in the UK and Tshinghua University in China. Equipped with a strong faculty,
            a well-groomed library and an array of sophisticated facilities for prototyping and manufacturing and
            associated research, CPDM has a vibrant atmosphere to develop future leaders in manufacturing
            research.</p><br>
        <p>
            CPDM hosts a technology business incubator (TBI) in MedTech with special focus on Geriatric
            Healthcare funded by KBITS, GOK. The TBI is intended to support innovators via a programme that
            straddles incubation, training and mentorships, as well as having access to four state of the art
            facilities in the areas of mechanical, chemical, biological and user testing. It is also extending its
            earlier
            work on developing India's first indigenous Smart Factory into a demonstration platform for industry
            called I4.0India@IISc (I for India at IISc). The platform is being developed as a Common Engineering
            Facility Centre (CEFC) under the SAMARTH Udyog Bharat 4.0 programme of the department of Heavy
            Industries, GoI. A major thrust of research at CPDM in manufacturing is developing new processes,
            technologies and tools for supporting development of complex and advanced manufacturing systems.
            For fostering international research into manufacturing in India, CPDM initiated a major conference
            series called I-4AM (pronounced I forum) - International Conference series on Industry 4.0 and
            Advanced Manufacturing. Its first edition will be held during 28-29 June 2019 at Indian Institute of
            Science Bangalore, to deliver international quality at affordable price.</p><br>
        <p>
            Research students are selected thorough a stringent selection procedure comprising a rigorous and
            extensive interview, in order to determine their individual ability and motivation. Based on the
            background of the student, each research student will be allocated a research topic at the time of
            admission, from among the topics of research offered for admission in the year of admission. Each
            student will be jointly supervised by two faculty members among those who are involved in the
            manufacturing programme (see list of faculty members involved in the manufacturing programme
            below).</p><br>
        <p>
            Ph.D. at IISc generally requires three and half years of extensive, in-depth research. A PhD student is
            expected to make major contributions in philosophy, understanding or enhancement of the state of
            the art in manufacturing.</p><br>
        <p>
            MTech by Research [MTech(R)] is generally a two years research course. MTech(R) students are
            required to enrol more courses than that required for PhD students. MTech(R) is a perfect blend of
            course work and research, thus providing students with freedom to take up further either doctoral
            research, join a company where both research and general design are essential, or initiate/join a
            startup.</p>
